# TS-NGCF

This is the implementation for NGCF recommendation model by TypeScript, based on paper [Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://hexiangnan.github.io/papers/sigir19-NGCF.pdf). Before running this project, please install Bun. 

Then install dependencies.

Here is my [reading record and thoughts](https://www.yuque.com/yuqueyonghuwznrio/zt8wa9/nqbokcb5cr82e3cl#%20%E3%80%8ANGCF%E3%80%8B).

```bash
bun install
```

And, run this command in terminal.

```bash
bun run start
```

Or, you could build to single js file and run with node.js

```bash
bun run build:js
node ./out/main.js
```
